To ensure you correctly interpret and process our Markdown file (ICAO_Pans_Annexes.md), please familiarize yourself with the following formatting logic and conventions we've used:

1. **Book Separation:**
   - **Books are separated by a horizontal rule** consisting of three dashes `---` on its own line.
   - This separator indicates that the content following it belongs to a new book.
   - **Example:**
     ```
     [Content of Book 1]

     ---

     [Content of Book 2]
     ```

2. **Metadata Section:**
   - Each book begins with metadata that provides key information.
   - **Book Name:** Presented as a Level 1 heading using a single `#`. For example:
     ```
     # Book Name
     ```
   - **Metadata Fields:** Listed below the book name, each on its own line, formatted in bold using double asterisks `**`:
     - **Document Number:** Unique identifier for the document.
     - **Organization:** Name of the issuing organization.
     - **Revision Date:** Date of the latest revision (e.g., "2023-10-15").
     - **Edition:** Edition of the document.
     - **Example:**
       ```
       **Document Number:** 12345

       **Organization:** Example Organization

       **Revision Date:** 2023-10-15

       **Edition:** Second Edition
       ```

3. **Heading Structure:**
   - We use Markdown heading levels to represent the hierarchical structure of the document.
   - The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the depth of the section:
     - `#` for Level 1 headings (e.g., chapters).
     - `##` for Level 2 headings.
     - `###` for Level 3 headings, and so on, up to `######` for Level 6.
   - **Numeric Headings:** For headings with numbered sections like "5.2.1.1.3", we count the number of numeric segments to determine the heading level:
     - **Example:**
       ```
       ## 5.2
       ### 5.2.1
       #### 5.2.1.1
       ##### 5.2.1.1.3
       ```

4. **Table of Contents:**
   - Included as a Level 2 heading using `##`:
     ```
     ## Table of Contents
     ```
   - Lists major sections or chapters as bullet points.

5. **Definitions and Abbreviations Section:**
   - Typically located in **Chapter 1**, after the **Foreword**.
   - **Formatting of Terms:**
     - **Bold term(s)** ending with a dot (`.`). These are the terms being defined.
     - The **definition text** follows the term and continues until the next bold term appears.
     - **Example:**
       ```
       **Term.** The definition of the term goes here and may span multiple lines or paragraphs until the next term is introduced.

       **Another Term.** The definition of the next term.
       ```
   - **Abbreviations** are formatted similarly.

6. **Paragraphs and Sentences:**
   - Regular text is written in paragraphs.
   - Sentences within paragraphs are separated by single spaces unless they are meant to start a new paragraph.

7. **Tables:**
   - Extracted tables are converted into Markdown table format.
   - Inserted into the content following the headings or sections they belong to.

8. **Headers and Footers:**
   - Headers and footers from the original PDF (like page numbers or repeated section titles) are intentionally omitted to maintain content clarity.

9. **Special Text Handling:**
   - **Bold Text:** Used for terms and headings as specified.
   - **Italics and Underlines:** Not commonly used unless they appear in the original document with specific significance.

By understanding and applying these conventions—including recognizing the `---` separator between books—you will be able to accurately process the combined Markdown file, preserving the intended structure, hierarchy, and metadata of the original documents.

**Additional Note on Processing Multiple Books:**

- When processing the Markdown file, treat the content between each `---` separator as a distinct book.
- Ensure that metadata and content are associated correctly with each book.
- **Example of Multiple Books in Markdown:**

  ```
  # Book Name 1

  **Document Number:** 12345

  **Organization:** Organization A

  **Revision Date:** 2023-10-15

  **Edition:** First Edition

  [Content of Book 1]

  ---

  # Book Name 2

  **Document Number:** 67890

  **Organization:** Organization B

  **Revision Date:** 2023-11-01

  **Edition:** Second Edition

  [Content of Book 2]
  ```

By incorporating this convention into your processing logic, you can correctly identify where one book ends and another begins, ensuring that metadata and content are accurately parsed and associated.
